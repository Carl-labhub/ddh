## Report for `r fav_gene_summary$approved_symbol`: `r fav_gene_summary$approved_name`  
### from datadrivenhypothesis.org  
`r lubridate::stamp("Report generated December 31, 1979")(now())`  
  
## Project Summary  
Data-driven hypothesis is a resource for identifying novel functions for human genes developed by the [Hirschey Lab](www.hirscheylab.org). A typical use case starts by querying a gene, identifying genes that share similar patterns or behaviors across various measures, in order to discover new novel genes in established processes or new processes for well-studied genes.  This project leverages several high-quality publically available datasets, including release `r release` of the [Dependency Map](www.depmap.org) from the [Broad Institute](www.broadinstitute.org).  
  
## Query Summary  
**Gene**: `r fav_gene_summary$approved_symbol`  
**Name**: `r fav_gene_summary$approved_name`  
**aka**: `r fav_gene_summary$aka`  
**Entrez ID**: `r as.integer(fav_gene_summary$ncbi_gene_id)`
  
`r fav_gene_summary$entrez_summary`  

## No dependency data from DepMap
This gene query is not present in the `r release` of the data. This could be because the gene was not included in the raw data or because viability after gene ablation was measured in fewer than `r nrow(achilles) - na_cutoff` cell lines that contained its expression. Future data releases might result in `r fav_gene_summary$approved_symbol` being included in the datadrivenhypothesis.org resource.
